        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Iviwe Tyelentombi, an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Cape Town, with a vision of becoming a transformative engineer. Driven by a deep interest in technology and innovation, I aspire to contribute to solving real-world challenges through creative and sustainable engineering solutions. I am passionate about exploring how electrical engineering can shape the future, especially in addressing issues like energy efficiency and technology integration in everyday life.

            Throughout my academic journey, I’ve strived to not only excel in my studies but also develop the problem-solving and leadership skills necessary for a successful engineering career. I am committed to continuous growth and making a positive impact. As I continue to build my knowledge in electrical engineering and computer science, my goal is to one day work on groundbreaking projects that improve lives and contribute to the advancement of the engineering field.
